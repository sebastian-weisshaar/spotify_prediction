# Spotify prediction
In this group project we used Spotify data on the accoustics of a song to predict whether it is a hit or a flop. The final paper is the [AC209.pdf](https://github.com/sebastian-weisshaar/spotify_prediction/blob/main/AC209.pdf) file and the code can be found in the jupyter notebook. We used the following data 'https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/theoverman/the-spotify-hit-predictor-dataset'
