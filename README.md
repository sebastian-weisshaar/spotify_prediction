# Spotify prediction
In this group project we used Spotify data on the accoustics of a song to predict whether it is a hit or a flop. The final paper is the AC209.pdf and the code in the jupyter notebook. The data can be found here 'https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/theoverman/the-spotify-hit-predictor-dataset'
